# Embedded Streaming Project:
An overview on ESP-32 board and it's streaming capabilities.


## Progress:
- ### LED Blink Test:   
  We started with the basics by successfully implementing a simple LED blink test on the ESP32 board. This served as a foundational step to ensure that our hardware setup was correct and that we could effectively program the board.

- ### Bluetooth Connection:  
  Following the successful LED blink test, we moved on to integrating Bluetooth functionality. We are thrilled to report that we have established a robust Bluetooth connection with the ESP32 board. This opens up a myriad of possibilities for wireless communication and control, laying the groundwork for more advanced features in our project.

- ### Streaming WebServer:  
  Expanding our project's capabilities, we have successfully integrated video streaming on the ESP32 board. This accomplishment significantly enhances the project's versatility and applicability, showcasing the robust processing power of the ESP32 platform.

## Next Steps:
- ### Capturing and Processing Frames
  Building on our success, our next focus is on capturing and processing individual frames of the streaming data. This step is crucial for advancing the project's capabilities and overall functionality.
